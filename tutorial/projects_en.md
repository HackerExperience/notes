Projects are workspaces dedicated to a specific subject. Think of it as //tags//. People can subscribe to different projects. Examples of projects include #elixir, #infrastructure, #bug, #game_design and #hacker_experience_2.

In order to access the Projects application, click on `Projects` located on the left menu.
